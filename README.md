# TaskAPI - This project is a test API that doesn't have controls making it minimal.
In this API I've used:
  1. Visual Studio Web API Minimal Template(ASP.NET Core Web API - Minimal API Settings).
  2. I've used memory management, without Database.
  3. I use Data Annotation to apply properties to entities.
  4. I've applied Get, Post, Put and Delete methods that works.
